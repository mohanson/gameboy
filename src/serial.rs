// Communication between two Gameboys happens one byte at a time. One Gameboy acts as the master, uses its internal
// clock, and thus controls when the exchange happens. The other one uses an external clock (i.e., the one inside the
// other Gameboy) and has no control over when the transfer happens. If it hasn't gotten around to loading up the next
// data byte at the time the transfer begins, the last one will go out again. Alternately, if it's ready to send the
// next byte but the last one hasn't gone out yet, it has no choice but to wait.
